There is also a zipper compartment on the front of the bag.  On the inside of the front compartment, there is another small pocket, which opens with a velcro flap.I can fit my AC battery charger along with an extra battery pack in the front compartment.  I keep my memory card case, an extra memory card, & warranty receipt in the little pocket inside the front compartment.  In one side pocket, I have my car adapter & European adapter for the charger.  In the other side pocket, is my video cable.  There is a nice rubber-padded handle on the top & an adjustable shoulder strap that can be removed.The main compartment is about 6 inches tall x 4 inches wide x 3 inches deep.
